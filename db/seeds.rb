# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# products = Product.new({name: "jujuba", price: 2, flavor: "sweet", image: "none"}) 
# products.save 
# products = Product.new({name: "bala_bombom", price: 2, flavor: "sweet", image: "none"})
# products.save 
# products = Product.new({name: "amendoim", price: 2, flavor: "sweet", image: "none"})
# products.save 

# 10.times do 
#   {
#     products = Product.new({name: Faker::Food.fruits, price: Faker::Number.within(range: 1..10), flavor: Faker::Food.spice, image: "none"})
#   }
